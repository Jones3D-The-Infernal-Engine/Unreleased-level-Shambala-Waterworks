# Unreleased-level-Shambala-Waterworks

A level was planned between Shambala Santuary and Palawan Lagoon: Shambala Waterworks. It was never included in the final game due to lack of time and technical problems. No one has seen this level since 1999 but many files have been forgotten in the game. (I'm sure it would be possible to make it work again if we had it, or recreate it if not ...)

In this level, the first step was to find to melt an ice dam in order to supply water to the whole station. For that you had to find an Oil jar, break it on the ice dam and fire the lacquer with the Zippo.
So you knew how to access the main cave. The next step was to complete three "Div rooms" in any order you want, which must be opened with "Silver key", "Gold key" and "Garnet key". The level was filled with mills, sluices and various mechanisms. The goal of this whole operation was to free four gates leading to the Ice Boss.

Two areas of this level have been cut and kept in other levels:

- Div Room 2 (The flour mill): now in Tian Shan River. (You can see a walled-up entrance that is no longer useful)
- The Ice Boss Arena: now in Shambala Santuary. (Originally, the Shambala Santuary level ended after giving the flower to the old lady).
